    "- Recursive method is a method that calls itself. It will have at least one base case that will eventually halt the recursion\n",
    "- Binary search: taking first and last numbers, then find midpoint until we can narrow the term down\n",
    "- Can use recursion with binary search\n",
    "- Merge sort is another method to search with recursion\n",
    "- Merge sort divides the array into halves, then calls itself for the two different halves in order to sort them. It merges the two sorted halves into one list\n",
    "- Recursion trees can be used to visualize a recursive call\n",
    "- With recursion trees, you can trace down every call until the base case"
