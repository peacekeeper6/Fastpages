    "- For-Each loop doesn't have the ability to change the elements in an ArrayList (Java) or arrays (other languages), while for loop does\n",

    "- Removing an index of an array will shift all of the elements over (ex. remove data[0] then data[1] is now data[0] and so on)\n",
    "- compareTo() method: returns 0 if strings are equal, returns < 0 if string is less than other string (if comparing characters like \"g\" and \"f\", then \"g\" is lexicographically \"lower\" than \"f\"), returns > 0 if string is more than other string (either more characters or if comparing characters the string that is doing the comparing comes before in the alphabet)\n",
    "- indexOf() method returns position of the first occurrence of the specified characters in a string <- IMPORTANT \n",
    "- If a superclass is made with a class that has the same name as it, it doesn't need a return type\n",
    "- Extends vs. Implements: Extends is used to extend a class's functionality, while Implements is when you are using the elements of a class. {Here is good example: class extends class, class implements interface, interface extends interface}\n",
    "- Even if a method has void attached to it but has a return statement in its body, it will still compile\n",
