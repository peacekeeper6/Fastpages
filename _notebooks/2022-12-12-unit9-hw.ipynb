    "# Notes\n",
    "- Superclasses can be used to extend inheritance to various subclasses\n",
    "- Use keyword super() to call the superclass if you want a subclass to inherit the characteristics of a superclass\n",
    "- Use @Override to indicate that you're overriding a method of the super class\n",
    "- Inheritance hierarchy - superclasses and subclasses generally organized into a single root tree structure. Attributes and methods that are associated with a specific class are inherited by lower levels of the hierarchy\n",
    "- Polymorphism is something that can be used when we have multiple classes that are related by inheritance. Used when a method is implemented to perform different different tasks in different classes. Allows a method to take on different \"forms\" based on the object is it acting upon\n",
    "- Superclass is the class that is located at the top of the every class hierarchy"
