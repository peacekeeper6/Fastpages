Additional Insights
- Agile methodology is differently based on the company
- The most important skill to have in the tech industry is continuous learning and not being concerned about things read on the news
- In learning the skill to work with computer systems, you feel a sense of self-fulfillment
- Also being able to adapt and be resilient is an important skill
- Most people who have high roles have the ability to listen and translate how technology will solve the problem at hand
The biggest challenge in the tech industry is probably interviews now

- Coding skills can translate out of software development
- Makes for more logical thinking
- Can help you devise answers from assumptions
