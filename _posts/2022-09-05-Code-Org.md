- Code.org helped me realize that objects can be created and used
- Once they are created, they can be used in other files/locations by being called and extended

![Code.org](/images/lf.PNG "Code.org PatternPainter")

- In this example, the PatternPainter object is created in a separate file and extends the Painter object from myNeighborhood.
- Important to objects that are extended are higher-up. Ex: tacos extends food

![]({{site.baseurl}}/images/neighborhood.PNG)

![Code.org](/images/neighborhood.PNG "Code.org Neighborhood")

- Then, myNeighborhood takes the PatternPainter object and creates a new instance of it, which allows it to be used as an object
- Shown here, methods are being used with the newly instantiated object
