attempts to complete three levels. A level in the game is represented by the Level class.

<p>(a) Write the getScore method, which returns the score for the most recently played game. Each game
consists of three levels. The score for the game is computed using the following helper methods.</p>
<ul>
<li>The isBonus method of the Game class returns true if this is a bonus game
and returns false otherwise.</li>
<li>The goalReached method of the Level class returns true if the goal has
been reached on a particular level and returns false otherwise.</li>
<li>The getPoints method of the Level class returns the number of points recorded
on a particular level. Whether or not recorded points are earned (included in the game
score) depends on the rules of the game, which follow.
The score for the game is computed according to the following rules.</li>
<li>Level one points are earned only if the level one goal is reached. Level two points are
earned only if both the level one and level two goals are reached. Level three points are
earned only if the goals of all three levels are reached.</li>
<li>The score for the game is the sum of the points earned for levels one, two, and three.</li>
<li>If the game is a bonus game, the score for the game is tripled.</li>

<p>(b) Write the playManyTimes method, which simulates the play of num games and returns the
highest game score earned. For example, if the four plays of the game that are simulated as a result of the
method call playManyTimes(4) earn scores of 75, 50, 90, and 20, then the method
should return 90.</p>
<p>Play of the game is simulated by calling the helper method play. Note that if play is called only
one time followed by multiple consecutive calls to getScore, each call to getScore will return
the score earned in the single simulated play of the game.</p>
<p>Complete the playManyTimes method. Assume that getScore works as intended, regardless
of what you wrote in part (a). You must call play and getScore appropriately in order to receive
full credit.</p>
